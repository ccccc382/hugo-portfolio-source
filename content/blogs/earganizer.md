> **"** stop struggleing with tangled wires, make your life nicer with a eargonizer.**"**

The eargonizer is a accessory that automatically rolls up your earbuds, and keeps them secure inside the enclosure.

I designed the eargonizer based on a idea that was pitched to me during a project in which me and other students had to run a small company producing our own product.
the design went trough multiple iterations. since the challenge was mainly in joining the two half's together while still allowing the mechanism to work and to allow the device to be dissembled. The final design was them 3d printed. This 3d print was used as a master for a set of silicon molds. these molds where then used to make epoxy versions of the product. the epoxy allowed us to create a nice marbled color effect on the finished product.
