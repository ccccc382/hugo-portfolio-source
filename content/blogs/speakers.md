a personal project where i designed, calculated, modeled and build a pair of custom passive speakers
i named them odyssey since the entire project was a journey for me, forcing me to use different skill sets.
the project started of with a set of salvaged drivers from a old B&O speaker set of which the amplifiers had malfunctioned.
the first step was to calculate the specification for an enclosure and to determine the cutoff values for the crossovers.
the next step was to model them in CAD.
using the plans made in cad the enclosure was made from wood and then stained into black and brown color scheme.
as icing on the cake a pair of custom speaker cables with engraved wooden y splitters and custom sleeving, where made to match the design.
