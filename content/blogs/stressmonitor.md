A project i worked on in the first semester of my study in sensor technology
fresh out of highschool this was my first real project for school.
The goal of this device was to measure stress in the wearer.
this was achieved by using a homemade light base heart rate sensor, a galvanic skin response sensor and body temprature sensor
