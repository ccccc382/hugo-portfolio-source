_This is a Project I did together with a group of fellow students._

> **"** Urban farming is not only possible, it is crucial. But it can't be >like the farming techniques of yore.**"**

For this Project a automated greenhouse with a webserver was developed.( note to self expand on the automation aspects)
it featured real time data monitoring trough a adaptive webapp and a automated control system to keep the plants healthy.

the modules the system consist of are made from recycled pallets nad pvc tubes
special care was taken to minimize the power consumption
each module was self contained and had a universal water connector a power connector and network port
this made the modules easier to implement in projects

a sensor system that used multiple sensors and a camera that measured inputs like: inside/outside temperature , air humidity, soil humidity, light levels and plant growth rate using a computer vision algorithm

A web UI was designed to display these value in a nice and easy to use interface
